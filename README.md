### **Summary** 
>The aim through this series of blog posts is to give the readers a brief insight into the various levels of autonomous driving systems. We will try to gain perspective on what constitutes as level 2 along with a couple of examples. A study into the data driven aspect of self driving as well as the holistic approach should definitely provide clarity. An overview into the data driven, modular and integrated systems have been provided. Vision techniques that cover Level 2 have been discussed along with an overview of the Tesla Autopilot. This is only the First part of a series of posts.
