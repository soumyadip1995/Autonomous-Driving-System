### **Summary** 
>The aim through this series of blog posts is to give the readers a brief insight into the various levels of autonomous driving systems. We will try to gain perspective on what constitutes as level 2 along with a couple of examples. A study into the data driven aspect of self driving as well as the holistic approach should definitely provide clarity. An overview into the data driven, modular and integrated systems have been provided. Vision techniques that cover Level 2 have been discussed along with an overview of the Tesla Autopilot. This is only the First part of a series of posts.

### **Summary**
>The aim through this blog post is to talk about Perception systems. Perception in an autonomous driving system is integral for both Level 2 and Level 4 systems. The purpose of Perceptual Systems can range in anything from Driving Perception i.e, Object detection, driving scene, Trajectory Generation etc. Any system that improves the robustness of the overall perception of an autonomous vehicle , can be consituted as a perception system . We will also look into a paper called [Arguing Machines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04459.pdf) where a neural Network goes head to head with the Tesla Autopilot that predict system disengagements that require human supervision.
